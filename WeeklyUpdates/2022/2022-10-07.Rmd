Well here it is, the first eMOLT weekly email ever that wasn't authored by 
**JiM Manning**. It's both an honor, and a really intimidating prospect to
follow up in his footsteps. Throughout my career, and especially over the last 
few weeks, I've heard time and time again that **JiM** does cooperative research
right; that he's someone who's passionate about the ocean and the people who 
make their livings on it. These are big shoes to fill, and I hope you'll all give me a chance and 
stick with the eMOLT program moving forward. I haven't had a chance to meet many
of the participating captains and crew (especially up in Maine), but I look forward to some
quality time together at the [2023 Forum](https://mainefishermensforum.org/) and/or [Mass Lobstermen's Weekend](https://lobstermen.com/annual-weekend/). For
those of you who won't be at either event or would like to chat before then, I'm
reachable by email (george.maynard@noaa.gov), text, or phone call (508-299-9693).
I look forward to working with all of you on this impressive research project
to keep collecting data for decades more as **JiM** takes a well-deserved break (although he plans to be in touch with this group at least once each month).


### Weekly Recap 

On Tuesday, **Giovanni Gianesin** and I went Chatham to 
install a few new instruments on the **F/V Noah**. Despite the pouring rain and
howling wind, **Captain Doug** and crewman **Tim** worked with us to set up an RFID
gear-in-gear-out system (to help make haul-by-haul fixed gear reporting easier for our Study Fleet partners) and an eMOLT dissolved oxygen / temperature system 
reporting via cell modem. Thanks to **Nick Lowell** for jumping online
that afternoon to remotely smooth over a hiccup on the deckbox. **Emma Fowler**
was able to get on board a few vessels including the
**F/V Nicole Leigh**, which will soon be receiving a brand new eMOLT rig. 
**Huanxin Xu** programmed a new SD card for the
**F/V Virginia Marise** so hopefully, one of us will be headed to Point Judith
in the near future to get that system back online and fix any other issues
that arise in the port between now and then. 

On Wednesday, I met with **Huanxin** and **Aubrey Ellertson** from the Commercial Fisheries Research Foundation at the 
Bourne Public Library to go through some of our data quality control checks and
talk about ways to improve fishermen's ability to access the data they collect.
As a reminder, if you are interested in being able to view your historic data, 
please check out [the ODN data portal](https://www.portal.fishydata.com/login/?next=/emolt/) 
and request an account. Your detailed data will remain confidential and viewable
only through that secure login. 

On Thursday, there was a potluck lunch to celebrate **JiM's** retirement at the
Woods Hole Lab. A special thanks goes out to retired captain and eMOLT participant **Dave Goethel** of the **F/V Ellen Diane**, who made 
the trek all the way down from New Hampshire for the party. **JiM's** colleagues 
shared a few stories of his willingness to listen to others, share his knowledge,
and do what it takes to get good science done, and **JiM** received a clamming
basket full of beer, coffee, and French pastries.

### Realtime Summary (Vessels with Rockblock Satellite Transmitters)

Thanks to the relentless remnants of Hurricane Ian, this was a quiet week on the water. 

This week, we received `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn,statement=paste0("SELECT * FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek, "' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` haul-averaged reports from `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn, statement=paste0("SELECT DISTINCT VESSEL_ID FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek,"' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` vessels.

![Status plot.](`r knitr::fig_chunk('statusPlot', 'png')`)

In the figure above, you can see the approximate locations where we receieved "Status Reports" (a ping from your system letting us know that it's still working) and "Data Uploads" (actual temperature / depth data collected by your probes). The "Status Reports" come in every 12 hours or so when a system is powered up. "Data Uploads" only come in when you haul the probes. 

One vessel that was out, the **F/V Terri Ann** returned some interesting results that show when Hurricane Fiona impacted their gear as it moved north towards the Maritimes around September 23rd-24th. You can see the pressure readings start to change rapidly as the storm system moves over the gear (gray line) followed by an increase in water temperature (red line).

### Announcements and Upcoming Weeks

I mentioned before that I'm looking forward to meeting with many of you at the Maine Fishermen's Forum next year, but there are other opportunities for commercial fishermen and scientists to get together before then. 

- The Cooperative Research Branch at the Northeast Fisheries Science Center is hosting two "Cooperative Research Summits" in early 2023 (January 31 in Newport News, VA and February 15 in Providence, RI) to highlight current coooperative research projects in the region and discuss opportunities for additional collaborations. There are stipends available to support fishermen attending. If you are interested, you can find more information [here](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/outreach-and-education/cooperative-research-fosters-regional-partnerships#2023-northeast-cooperative-research-summits). Registration is online and closes on **December 2, 2022**.

- Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (in collaboration with the Northeast Fisheries Science Center, Gulf of Maine Lobster Foundation, Commercial Fisheries Research Foundation, and Ocean Data Networks) is hosting a three day workshop exploring the possibility of creating an eMOLT-style biogeochemical sensor array up and down the Eastern Seaboard using fishing gear to deploy sensors. The workshop will focus on gathering input from the fishing industry, instrument manufacturers, and data users and will take place in Falmouth, MA from January 18-20, 2023. Again, there are stipends available for fishing industry members to attend. If you are interested, please fill out the [expression of interest form](https://us-ocb.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=be293460fdcca7c7856fb3819&id=41350bcab6&e=8760dfb114)

If you'd like a hand registering for either event, have questions about them, or just want to introduce yourself please dont hesitate to reach out by email, text, or call. 

All the best,

-George
