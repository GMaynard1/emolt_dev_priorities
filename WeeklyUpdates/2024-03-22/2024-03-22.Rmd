### Weekly Recap 
For several years, we have been processing bottom temperature records from the lobster larvae settlement traps off the coast of Maine. With Rick Wahle's retirement, the trap collections are now coordinated by other folks like Andrew Goode at the Lobster Institute. A few different fishermen have been involved each year with Minilog temperature probes install at three different depths off their region of the coast. This past year, HOBO temperature probes were also installed at the surface (see example timeseries figures below). We can see in Curt Brown's shallow (8 fth) site, the vertical stratification of temperature can break down for short periods (evidently due to wind, moon tide, or river runoff events) during the summer and more permanently in the fall. As can be seen in the map below for the Casco Bay case (currently occupied by Curt Brown and crew), the traps are located in different areas each year.

### Realtime Summary (Vessels with Rockblock Satellite Transmitters)

This week, we received `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn,statement=paste0("SELECT * FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek, "' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` haul-averaged reports from `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn, statement=paste0("SELECT DISTINCT VESSEL_ID FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek,"' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` vessels.

In the figure above, you can see the approximate locations where we received "Status Reports" (a ping from your system letting us know that it's still working) and "Data Uploads" (actual temperature / depth data collected by your probes). The "Status Reports" come in every 12 hours or so when a system is powered up. "Data Uploads" only come in when you haul the probes. If you were out fishing and don't see your approximate locations on here, please reach out because there may be a problem with your system.

### Bottom Temperature Forecasts

*We plan to add more animations to this section with other models in the future*

#### Northeast Coastal Ocean Forecast System (NECOFS)

![NECOFS Forecast](NECOFS.gif)

Above, please find the bottom temperature forecasts at one hour intervals from 
the Northeast Coastal Ocean Forecast System run by the 
[Chen Lab](http://fvcom.smast.umassd.edu/) at the University of Massachusetts 
School for Marine Science and Technology in New Bedford.
