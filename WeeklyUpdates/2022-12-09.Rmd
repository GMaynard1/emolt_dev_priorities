### Weekly Recap 

Bob Baines, a prominent member of the Maine Lobstermen Association and longterm eMOLT participant, mailed in his Minilog probe this past week.
Like many of the original eMOLT lobstermen, Bob is fishing shorter seasons as he approaches retirement age. In 2022, he had his probe in the water only for a few months but,
as seen in the graphic below, it was enought to document his 48 fathom (87 meters) site being warm like last year.

### Realtime Summary (Vessels with Rockblock Satellite Transmitters)

This week, we received `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn,statement=paste0("SELECT * FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek, "' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` haul-averaged reports from `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn, statement=paste0("SELECT DISTINCT VESSEL_ID FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek,"' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` vessels.

*Figure 2 - eMOLT Satellite Transmitter status plot for the previous week.*

In the figure above, you can see the approximate locations where we received "Status Reports" (a ping from your system letting us know that it's still working) and "Data Uploads" (actual temperature / depth data collected by your probes). The "Status Reports" come in every 12 hours or so when a system is powered up. "Data Uploads" only come in when you haul the probes. If you were out fishing and don't see your approximate locations on here, please reach out because there may be a problem with your system.

### Data Portal News

We are continuing to load all of the data that this program has collected over the last few decades into our new database, which interfaces with the Ocean Data Network portal to provide easy, on-demand access to data visualizations for fishermen who are interested in viewing their historic data. So far, we are up to 4.2 million individual temperature/depth records in the database, with millions more to go. If you are interested in seeing your data on the portal, please reach out and let me know. **Phil Michaud** I'm hoping to have all of your historic data loaded by the end of the day today! Data for **Jordan Drouin**, **Josh Miller**, and **Jim Barclay** should be all or mostly loaded already. If you can't access it or it looks incomplete, please let me know!

### Announcements and Upcoming Weeks

- The Cooperative Research Branch at the Northeast Fisheries Science Center is hosting two "Cooperative Research Summits" in early 2023 (January 31 in Newport News, VA and February 15 in Providence, RI) to highlight current coooperative research projects in the region and discuss opportunities for additional collaborations. There are stipends available to support fishermen attending. If you are interested, you can find more information [here](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/outreach-and-education/cooperative-research-fosters-regional-partnerships#2023-northeast-cooperative-research-summits). Registration is online and closes **TODAY**. 

- There is also a workshop scheduled at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute on January 18-20 as described [here](https://www.us-ocb.org/coastal-bgc-obs-network-with-fishing-community/) to discuss the feasibility of getting some National Science Foundation funding to incorporate additional sensors (salinity, pH, etc.) into an eMOLT style program coastwide. We especially encourage participation from fishermen and have funding available to cover travel and lodging. If you are interested, the registration for this event is online [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJ9QA94Lm7LrKmOHTo36gUyB0eOlcWcKnAz6BXDyp76QTzHg/viewform?usp=sf_link) and closes on **December 16, 2020** 

All the best,

-George and JiM
