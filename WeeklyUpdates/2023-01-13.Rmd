### Weekly Recap 

Pete Begley (Little Bay Lobsters) mailed in his two non-realtime probes this week with year-round data from both (164 and 183 fathoms) Gulf of Maine.
As seen in the case of the deeper site in the plot below, it was a relatively warm year and ended in being the warmest December of all the years they have deployed at these locations. The interesting thing about these deep sites is the lack of a seasonal cycle.

### Realtime Summary (Vessels with Rockblock Satellite Transmitters)

This week, we received `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn,statement=paste0("SELECT * FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek, "' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` haul-averaged reports from `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn, statement=paste0("SELECT DISTINCT VESSEL_ID FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek,"' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` vessels.

*Figure 2 - eMOLT Satellite Transmitter status plot for the previous week.*
In the figure above, you can see the approximate locations where we received "Status Reports" (a ping from your system letting us know that it's still working) and "Data Uploads" (actual temperature / depth data collected by your probes). The "Status Reports" come in every 12 hours or so when a system is powered up. "Data Uploads" only come in when you haul the probes. If you were out fishing and don't see your approximate locations on here, please reach out because there may be a problem with your system.

### Miniboat news
The Waterford CT High School's R/V Neil Armstrong-deployed miniboat "Lady Lance" has been at sea for a few months. After revolving around a Gulf Stream Ring several times last month as shown in the animation below, it is now rotating around another ring as animated by the teacher at 

![2nd ring]('https://watch.screencastify.com/v/V1gaL4BNV9QZqkaCxUY7')

![1st ring]('2022-11-27NEC_DOPPIO_-1.gif'.  

This is just one of many interesting stories the miniboat project has to offer at, for example  Cassie's podcast website [here]('https://educationalpassages.org/podcast/'). A total of 44 deployments were made in 2022.

### Announcements
- We look forward to seeing about 10 eMOLT participants at the workshop next week in Woods Hole. Some have been assigned to participate in a panel discussion but if you are uncomfortable with that, let us know. We have alternates.

All the best,
George and JiM
