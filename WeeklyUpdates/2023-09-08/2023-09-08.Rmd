JiM got time this past week to work on a new satellite-tracked surface drifter design. After testing the prototype Falmouth Harbor (see photos), he found more ballast needed below the foam-filled mast. 
The objective in this buoyless case, as in all previous designs, is to minimize windage, maintain oceanographic standards in approximate size/shape, minimizes dangers to both mariners and wildlife, and experiment with new more eco-friendly low-cost materials.
