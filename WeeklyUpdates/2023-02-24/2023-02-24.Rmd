### Weekly Recap 

For the past several years, we have supplied Rick Wahle's Lab at the Lobster Institute with Minilog temperature probes to install on some of their lobster larvae settlement traps. Both Curt Brown and
Jordan Drouin typically deploy three probes at different depths in their area. See station plots below. As part of our QA/QC routine, we check on the depths recorded in the log files
with those derived from bathymetric datasets. Often times, as in at least one site this year, we needed to check the positions as recorded in multiple ways (wheelhouse plotter, googlemaps, and webserved nautical charts). 
It is critical we be as accurate as possible in documenting these positions and depths. We need make sure, for example, there isn't any issues with units recorded.

### Realtime Summary (Vessels with Rockblock Satellite Transmitters)

This week, we received `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn,statement=paste0("SELECT * FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek, "' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` haul-averaged reports from `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn, statement=paste0("SELECT DISTINCT VESSEL_ID FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek,"' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` vessels.

*Figure 3 - eMOLT Satellite Transmitter status plot for the previous week.*
In the figure above, you can see the approximate locations where we received "Status Reports" (a ping from your system letting us know that it's still working) and "Data Uploads" (actual temperature / depth data collected by your probes). The "Status Reports" come in every 12 hours or so when a system is powered up. "Data Uploads" only come in when you haul the probes. If you were out fishing and don't see your approximate locations on here, please reach out because there may be a problem with your system.
### Announcements
We hope to see many of you at the Maine Fishermen's Forum next week. The eMOLT program is cohosting a symposium with our colleagues from Commercial Fisheries Research Foundation and Ocean Data Networks on Saturday at 1:00-2:30 in the Camden Room. If you're planning to attend the Forum, please stop by the symposium or the booth to meet George and provide your feedback and suggestions for the program.
All the best,
George and JiM
