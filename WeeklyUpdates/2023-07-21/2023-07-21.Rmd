### Software Improvements

This week, George and Huanxin spent some time torture testing the Deck Data Hub
software that we are hoping to roll out across the eMOLT fleet over the coming
months. This software is a blend of code from Lowell Instruments, Ocean Data 
Network, and the original python scripts developed by JiM, Huanxin, and many interns.
By working off a unified code base, we hope to make troubleshooting more efficient,
provide some of the features our industry partners have been asking for, and 
streamline our data transmission. 

For those of you who haven't seen this software yet, you can check out some 
screenshots and features below:

- In the top left, the color of the vessel icon indicates which version of the
software is running, so we know if your box needs a major update or not.
- In the middle up top is a network connection indicator showing whether your 
vessel is connected to a WiFi network, cellular network, or neither.
- **In the top right is a feature that our industry partners have requested time 
and time again -- a screen dimmer!**
- On the bottom left the cloud message indicates whether your vessel is successfully
transmitting data to the cloud or not.
- The tabs across the top allow you to toggle back and forth between the main 
status screen, plots of data, and an information screen that shows the time of
the last interaction your deckbox had with your logger(s) and whether it successfully downloaded the data from the logger or not. 
- In the middle of the screen is a large icon indicating your system's current
activity. In this case, the system is in "resting" mode to save power while the
vessel is stationary in port.

Just as important as unifying what people see on their deckboxes is unifying
the information we receive on the back end. For example, the new software sends
email updates back to the eMOLT team whenever a deckbox powers up, successfully
downloads a logger, or runs into an error, all information that will help us
keep your systems running smoothly and (hopefully) reduce the number of times
we call to bug you about why the system isn't working. 

Finally, the new software transmits data into a pipeline connected directly to
our new database. That means the data you collect are available almost immediately
to the modelers who rely on that information to improve their ocean forecasts.
Additionally, having a single storehouse of data makes it easier for us to 
leverage all of this information for other scientific research beyond 
ocean forecasts. 


### Hardware Improvements

In addition to improving the software on the boxes, we're also looking for ways
to make the hardware more resilient without breaking the bank. Recently, we've
begun heat-shrinking the power connections outside the box to reduce problems 
with rusting and cables vibrating out of place.

One great thing about working with fishermen and scientists is that there's no
shortage of creative problem solvers in the room. If you have an idea for making
these boxes more resilient to life on board commercial fishing vessels, please
feel free to reach out!

### Acknowledgements

Thanks this week to Chris and Captain Mike at Sea Watch International 
for your efforts to get the F/V Sea Watcher II online. We appreciate you
being so communicative and making sure everything was up and running.

Thanks also to Owen and Captain Willis up in Provincetown for bringing the
F/V Donna Marie back online after a long hiatus due to bluetooth problems.

### Announcements

- The [Woods Hole Science Stroll](https://woodsholesciencestroll.org/) is back on this year! On August 12, we welcome
anyone who's interested in meeting scientists and learning more about the work
we do to come down to Water Street in Woods Hole. In addition to the Cooperative
Research Branch staff many of you already know and other NOAA Fisheries scientists
staff from other scientific organizations will be around giving demos of hardware 
and explaining their research. We'd be happy to have you stop in! Participating
organizations include:
    - Marine Biological Laboratory
    - US Coast Guard
    - US Geological Survey
    - Woodwell Climate Research Center
    - Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
  ...and more!

- The [Commercial Fishing Business Cost Survey](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/commercial-fishing/commercial-fishing-business-cost-survey?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) is live for vessel owners to provide feedback on the economic realities faced by people who run fishing businesses. The survey closes July 31. 

- The [Commercial Fishing Crew Survey](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/socioeconomics/2023-commercial-fishing-crew-survey?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) is an opportunity for crewmembers and hired vessel operators to provide information about the social and economic well-being of commercial fishing vessel crews and better understand how management and environmental change affect important, socially vulnerable groups.

- Our colleagues  at the Northeast Fisheries Science Center recently published a report on the [Current Conditions of the Northeast U.S. Shelf Ecosystem](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/ecosystems/current-conditions-northeast-us-shelf-ecosystem-spring-2023?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) focusing on surface dynamics during the second half of 2022. 

All the best,
George and JiM
