We have been exposing temperature probes in a stirred ice-bath every year in order to check on their performance and calibration. Each time we conduct this operation, we improve our methods. This past Tuesday, for example, we met in JiM's basement laboratory and worked together on a modified-method which requires less man-hours. George and Huanxin devised a contraption where the 0.01 degC accurate handheld Fluke thermistor could be monitored via the laptop movie setup. This new method eliminates the need to manually record each observation in realtime. The results of the test are shown below where we compared four different instrument models and found they differed by a few tenths of a degree. We question whether these differences are due to the small 5-gallon bucket vessel and/or the smaller pump used (50 gph).  We plan to conduct another test of instruments in the coming weeks including the pressure-triggered models like Creare and Moana.

### Realtime Summary (Vessels with Rockblock Satellite Transmitters)

This week, we received `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn,statement=paste0("SELECT * FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek, "' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` haul-averaged reports from `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn, statement=paste0("SELECT DISTINCT VESSEL_ID FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek,"' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` vessels.

*eMOLT Satellite Transmitter status plot for the previous week.*
In the figure above, you can see the approximate locations where we received "Status Reports" (a ping from your system letting us know that it's still working) and "Data Uploads" (actual temperature / depth data collected by your probes). The "Status Reports" come in every 12 hours or so when a system is powered up. "Data Uploads" only come in when you haul the probes. If you were out fishing and don't see your approximate locations on here, please reach out because there may be a problem with your system.

### Announcements
- Recently, we've heard reports from some lobstermen about shells not hardening up as much as they used to. If you've noticed something similar, please reach out. Shell hardness can be influenced by many environmental factors including water temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen. 
- We appreciate your patience as we work our way through the waitlist of vessels. We rely on grant funds to expand eMOLT to new platforms, and those grants often have specific goals. For example, we recently wrapped up a major effort here in Massachusetts to outfit 12 additional vessels that was funded by the Massachusetts Seaport Economic Council. That project was designed to dovetail with and support the Cape Cod Bay Dissolved Oxygen Study Fleet organized by Tracy Pugh at MADMF. Our next large scale deployment will be funded by the Lobster Institute to add 6-12 new vessels in Mid-Coast Maine and Downeast. There are additional vessels in New Bedford and on Cape Cod who we're working to find systems for as well. 
- For those of you who've caught the research bug and are looking for another piece of environmental data to collect off your vessels, consider checking out the [SeaHawk Project](https://coast-lab.org/hawkeyeCitSci/). This project uses low-cost Secchi disks to ground-truth water clarity measurements taken from satellite imagery, which is one way to study phytoplankton abundance. For more information, please contact [Delaney McBride](dam2534@uncw.edu) at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. 
All the best,
George and JiM
