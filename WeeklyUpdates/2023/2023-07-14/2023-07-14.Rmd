Over the last two weeks, we've been working  with several industry partners to get our dissolved oxygen monitors deployed in support of [MADMF's Cape Cod Bay Study Fleet program](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/tracking-dissolved-oxygen-with-the-cape-cod-bay-study-fleet-and-dmf). Thanks to Captain Tony on the F/V Raider III and Captain Dave on the F/V Grace Sarah for signing up for another year of supporting this program. Next week, we hope to complete our installs with Captain Frank on the F/V Sarah K. 

Just a reminder for all eMOLT participants with AC powered systems, not all power supplies are created equal. Although all the pieces fit together to use a cell phone charger with your deckbox, oftentimes those chargers don't output enough juice. If you're experiencing issues with your box power cycling, not powering on, or periodically shutting down for no apparent reason, check the power supply. It should be rated for at least 3 amps.

As I mentioned the other week, we've started our installs up in the Gulf of Maine, but appear to have hit a bit of a stumbling block on the F/V Ella V. Without a functioning wi-fi connection, it's tough to deal with software bugs happening nearly five hours away. Thanks to Captain Jamien for his patience with us as we try to resolve the issues on this system. Hopefully we can get it off of his boat and into the lab at UMaine where the internet connection is more stable. 

Along those lines, if you've noticed an issue with your system, please feel free to reach out. We can't be everywhere at once, but we can't fix things if we don't know they're broken. This week, we were able to take action on a text from Captain Mike on the F/V Adventure to get his system back up and running. Phone calls, texts, picture messages, and even Facebook messenger are all good ways to get in touch, so please don't hesitate to let me know. 

On the drifter front, thank you to everyone who reached out after the email a few weeks ago. The drifters on Isle au Haut and Nantucket have both been recovered.
