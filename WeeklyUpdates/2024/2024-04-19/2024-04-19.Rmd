### Weekly Recap 

Huanxin has been working hard on migrating all of the data generated by the realtime eMOLT program over the years from our old servers to our new cloud infrastructure. This migration is necessary to ensure all of the eMOLT data are stored in a standardized, accessible way so that we can respond quickly to data requests from stock assessment scientists, forecasters, and the fishing industry. However, like any major change, there are often growing pains. In this case, a strangely formatted file in the mix put enough sand in the gears to stall out our new ERDDAP server. So if you've noticed a lack of new data there, that's why.

### New Research

- A team from Rutgers and NOAA Fisheries is working on better understanding how surfclams respond to increased ocean temperatures and acidification. You can learn more about the project [here](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/science-blog/how-do-atlantic-surfclams-respond-ocean-warming-and-acidification?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery)



### Announcements and Other News

- The New England Fishery Management Council is hosting three workshops to solicit public input on the Atlantic Cod Management Transition Plan. For more information please [click here](https://d23h0vhsm26o6d.cloudfront.net/NEFMC-Schedules-Three-Facilitated-Workshops-to-Solicit-Public-Input-on-Atlantic-Cod-Management-Transition-Plan.pdf). The workshops are in Portland on 4/30, Wakefield MA on 5/1, and South Kingstown RI on 5/2. All workshops beging at 0930. 

- On-demand lobster and Jonah crab gear testing is underway off Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Science Center scientists are working with commercial lobster vessels to test on-demand (ropeless) fishing gear in state and federal waters normally closed to lobster and Jonah crab fishing with static vertical lines. Testing in this area will occur through April 30, 2024.

Because on-demand gear has no surface buoys, it won’t be visible at the surface. To visualize the gear positions and orientations, mariners can download and subscribe to the EdgeTech Trap Tracker app ($25) on the [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trap-tracker/id1450280978) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.edgetech.TrapTracker&hl=en&gl=US) app stores. For more information on this work, click [here](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/marine-mammal-protection/2024-northeast-experimental-demand-gear-system).
Mariners: There is a potential gear conflict area immediately west of the Great South Channel in former Groundfish Closed Area 1. On-demand gear in that area is set northwest to southeast in trawls approximately 1.5 nautical miles in length. If anyone accidentally tows up the on-demand gear, don’t discard it. Hold onto the gear and contact our Gear Research Team. Contact info can be found [here](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/marine-mammal-protection/2024-northeast-experimental-demand-gear-system#contacts).

All the best,
