### Weekly Recap 


This week, the eMOLT fleet recorded `r length(unique(data$tow_id))` tows of sensorized fishing gear.

Bottom temperatures north of Cape Cod Bay remained in the low to mid 40s, although surface waters are defintely warming up down this way. Surface waters are almost 10 degrees warmer off Provincetown than they are Downeast. Check out the profiles below from just north of P-town, the South Shore, Southern Maine, and Downeast, where there was little difference between surface water and bottom water in 40 fathoms!

Up north, Andrew Goode hit the docks with the UMaine summer interns to continue our expansion in coastal Maine. A big thanks to Capt. Nick P. on the F/V All Out and Capt. Nick H. on the F/V Illusion for their patience in working through some troubleshooting with their systems. As we do more of these remote-supported installations, we'll keep refining the process. Thanks also to Jack Carroll from Ocean Data Networks and Capt. Mike on the F/V Fremantle Doctor for their patience as we updated the software on their deckbox. 

We've completed cleaning and disassembling the dissolved oxygen loggers and are waiting for a shipment of batteries before they're ready to put back out in the field. In the next few weeks, we'll be contacting vessels around Cape Cod and the South Shore to start getting those in the water. Lowell Instruments also shipped a batch of new dissolved oxygen sensors up to the Darling Marine Center for Andrew and his team to install over the coming weeks.

### Bottom Temperature Forecasts

#### Doppio Performance Last Week

Observations south of Long Island last week were cooler than predicted, as was the single observation off Provincetown. The one outlier where observations were substantially warmer than predicted was on the continental shelf break south of the Islands.
