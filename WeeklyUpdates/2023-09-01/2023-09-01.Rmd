## [Cape Cod Bay Dissolved Oxygen Snapshot](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/0d553dfc6c60487cb1f4d20b5366ee0b/page/Map-Page/)

Low DO areas in Cape Cod Bay appear to have receded or shifted over the last week. Since removing the logger that 
was reading low near Manomet, no other loggers in the area have documented low DO. DO concentrations also
appear to be slightly higher off Barnstable and Wellfleet than they were previously, although very low DO concentrations continue to be observed off Provincetown.
