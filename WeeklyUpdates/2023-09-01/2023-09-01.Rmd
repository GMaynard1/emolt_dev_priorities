This week, George presented an in depth description of eMOLT as part of the NOAA Science Seminar Series. Several scientists in attendance had ideas for putting the eMOLT data to use in their own research, which ranged from large-scale climate models to stock assessments. Another attendee was a data manager at the National Center for Environmental Information. He was particularly intrigued by the new profile data collected by eMOLT participants because that's something with a lot of value to his data users. 

Several years ago, the eMOLT team started to think of ways to measure bottom currents.  What resulted is a tilt current meter that, thanks to Vitalii Sheremet and Nick Lowell, has become a reality and seen many applications.  In addition to these measurements at fixed locations, we also considered ways to develop a "bottom drifter".  The first prototypes were made in 2019 and the results of these initial experiments were published this week [in the journal Aquatic Biology](https://peerj.com/articles/15866/).

Areas of low oxygen in Cape Cod Bay continue to occur in the eastern reaches while concentrations in the west seem normal.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to the Bottom Longline Survey team here at NEFSC and Captain Eric aboard the F/V Tenacious II for coordinating with George for some real time testing of the eMOLT system on that vessel to make sure it's ready to go before this year's survey. 
Thanks also to Captain Andy on the F/V Sea Watcher I for checking in to make sure the data was coming in off his system and for offering up some suggestions to improve the usability on his side. Your feedback is the only way we can make sure the system works for you, so don't be shy about reaching out. 

### Announcements

- The next [meeting of the New England Fisheries Management Council](https://www.nefmc.org/calendar/september-2023-council-meeting) will be September 25-28 in Plymouth, MA. 

- Saildrone is operating two Uncrewed Surface Vessels in the eastern third of the Gulf of Maine to collect high resolution bathymetric data from August 28 - October 18. Coordinates by date and contact information can be found [here](https://d23h0vhsm26o6d.cloudfront.net/Saildrone-Gulf-of-Maine-Mapping-Project-Announcement.pdf)

All the best,
