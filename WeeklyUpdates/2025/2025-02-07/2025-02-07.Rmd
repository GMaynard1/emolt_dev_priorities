## Weekly Recap 

This week, we continued bringing more systems online as the Rutgers crew rigged up the F/V Defiance down in Cape May and the ODN team worked with George, Huanxin, and Joaquim to iron out a few kinks on vessels up on the North Shore and in Southern Maine. Thanks to Captains Chad, Rusty, and Dominic for their patience this week. Thanks also to everyone who has followed up with us after the cooperative research summit, the Lobster Town Hall, and the Mass Lobstermen's Weekend. We received interest from over 30 new vessels and look forward to working with all of you.

It's cold out there, at least on the surface. The plot below shows sea surface temperature from the last four years as well as the anomaly relative to the time period from 2000-2020. This year, with the exception of the large warm ring around 64W, 40N it's much colder than it's been off the edge of the shelf. Thanks to Dr. Kim Hyde over in the Ecosystem Dynamics and Assessment Branch for sharing these images.

> *Figure 2 -- (Top) Sea surface temperatures for late January / early February in (L-R) 2022-2025. Blue represents colder temps, red represents warmer temps. (Bottom) Sea surface temperature anomaly (difference from the 2000-2020 average) for late January / early February in (L-R) 2022-2025. Purple represents water that's colder than average, yellow and orange are warmer than average.*

As always, it's helpful to have multiple pieces of data to be able to look at oceanographic conditions from different vantage points. Even with all that cold water at the surface, bottom conditions are actually much warmer in some places (see the magenta profile out on Eastern Georges where the temp around 100 fathoms is ~12 F warmer than the surface or the red profile near Hudson Canyon where temps are nearly 55 at the bottom, but only in the mid 40s at the surface). 

This week, the eMOLT fleet recorded `r length(unique(full_data$tow_id))` tows of sensorized fishing gear totaling `r as.numeric(sensor_time)` sensor hours underwater. The warmest recorded bottom temperature was `r round(max(full_data$temperature..degree_C.)*9/5+32,1)` F inside Cape Cod Bay in approximately `r round(full_data[which(full_data$temperature..degree_C.==max(full_data$temperature..degree_C.)),"depth..m."]*0.546807,0)` fathoms (red profile) and the coldest recorded bottom temperature was `r round(min(full_data$temperature..degree_C.)*9/5+32,1)` F near Hudson Canyon in approximately `r round(full_data[which(full_data$temperature..degree_C.==min(full_data$temperature..degree_C.)),"depth..m."]*0.546807,0)[1]` fathoms (blue profile). Below, you can see these profiles plus a few other temperature profiles of interest across the region from the last week. 

![profiles from this week](profiles.png)

> *Figure 3 -- Temperature profiles collected by eMOLT participants over the last week. The blue profile is where the coldest bottom temperature was measured and the red profile is where the warmest bottom temperature was measured. All other colors are assigned randomly. Colored points on the map indicate where profiles of the same color were collected. The small dark green dots represent other profiles collected this week, but not highlighted in the plot. Note that the warmest / coldest bottom temperatures measured could have occurred during gear soaks, which are not represented on this profile plot.*

Finally, we just wanted to offer a quick thanks to Capt. Malcolm on the F/V Bulldog who provided some feedback on ways we could improve the graphics in these emails. We'll see what we can do over the next few weeks. Please don't hesitate to reach out to George directly or to other folks in the Cooperative Research Branch if you have a suggestion or request.

### Bottom Temperature Forecasts

#### Doppio 

This week, 50% of bottom temperature observations were within 2 degrees (F) of the Doppio forecasted value at those points. Temps were warmer than expected along the northern edge of Georges, down by Hudson Canyon, and off the Maine coast. Temps were cooler than forecast on the shelf southeast of Great South Bay on Long Island. The forecast performed well southwest of Great South Bay, Cape Cod Bay, and along the backside of Cape Cod. 

![Doppio performance](doppio_compare.png)

> *Figure 4 -- Performance of the Doppio forecast's bottom temperature layer over the last week relative to observations collected by eMOLT participants. Red dots indicate areas where bottom temperature observations were warmer that predicted. Blue dots indicate areas where bottom temperature observations were cooler than predicted. Bottom temperature observations are compared with the most recent forecast run available before the observation was made.*
