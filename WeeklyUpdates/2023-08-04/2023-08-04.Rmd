Thanks primarily to our close colleague Cooper Van Vranken, an important paper was published this past week in Frontiers in Marine Science entitled "Towards a global Fishing Vessel Ocean Observing Network (FVON): State of the art and future directions" as seen [Frontiers paper]['https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2023.1176814']here. Both challenges and successes of several projects from around the world (eMOLT included) are described.

### Announcements

- The [Woods Hole Science Stroll](https://woodsholesciencestroll.org/) is back on this year! On August 12, we welcome
anyone who's interested in meeting scientists and learning more about the work
we do to come down to Water Street in Woods Hole. In addition to the Cooperative
Research Branch staff many of you already know and other NOAA Fisheries scientists
staff from other scientific organizations will be around giving demos of hardware 
and explaining their research. We'd be happy to have you stop in! Participating
organizations include:
    - Marine Biological Laboratory
    - US Coast Guard
    - US Geological Survey
    - Woodwell Climate Research Center
    - Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
  ...and more!



- The [Commercial Fishing Crew Survey](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/socioeconomics/2023-commercial-fishing-crew-survey?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) is an opportunity for crewmembers and hired vessel operators to provide information about the social and economic well-being of commercial fishing vessel crews and better understand how management and environmental change affect important, socially vulnerable groups.

All the best,
George and JiM
