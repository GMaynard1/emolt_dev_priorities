Early Friday morning (12 May), the miniboat that was deployed by R/V Neil Armstrong back in November south of New England, approached the Azorean Island of Graciosa. Cassie and I alerted colleagues who have recovered units there before and, within hours, they rallied their troups and recovered the unit before it might have crashed on the rocks. ![Lady lance]['lady_lance_recovery.jpg']. You can see the full story at [lady_lance]['http://educationalpassages.org/boats/ladylance'].

Last thursday (18 May), most of the eMOLT crew participated in a session at the Ocean Race Event in Newport called "Enabling Tolls for Citizen Science in Ocean Data Collection". While there were very few in the audience, we got to meet fellow speakers in person for the first time involved with, for example, OpenCtds, Smart-Buoys, and the Sailing4Science as well as the organizers from the the European Marine Observation and Data Network. See pic below. [newport]['newport_ocean_race_pic.jpg']

We occasionally hear from a few colleagues with Jules Verne-like ideas about the future.   They may be thinking ahead of our times but they are sincere about their quest to observe the sub-surface whatever way it takes.  There is lots of activity on the surface but, even now, more than 150 years after Verne's prophecies, little is known or understood about the deep.  In the words of Verne ![pictured below]['jverne.jpg'] himself, "The sea does not belong to depots. Upon its surface men can still make unjust laws, fight, tear one another to pieces, wage wars of terrestrial horror. But thirty feet below their reign ceases, their influence is quenched, and their power disappears."

### Realtime Summary (Vessels with Rockblock Satellite Transmitters)

This week, we received `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn,statement=paste0("SELECT * FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek, "' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` haul-averaged reports from `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn, statement=paste0("SELECT DISTINCT VESSEL_ID FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek,"' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` vessels.

*eMOLT Satellite Transmitter status plot for the previous week.*
In the figure above, you can see the approximate locations where we received "Status Reports" (a ping from your system letting us know that it's still working) and "Data Uploads" (actual temperature / depth data collected by your probes). The "Status Reports" come in every 12 hours or so when a system is powered up. "Data Uploads" only come in when you haul the probes. If you were out fishing and don't see your approximate locations on here, please reach out because there may be a problem with your system.
