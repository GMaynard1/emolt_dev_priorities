JiM has been experimenting with a new open-source "particle tracking" routine, recently developed by oceanographers in Norway, called "OpenDrift". It allows one to numerically simulate drifter tracks through modeled ocean circulation fields.  Thanks to some help from our Rutger's colleagues, he was able to make some initial tests of the system using three student-built units currently drifting in the Gulf of Maine. As see here at [last_month_tracks](https://studentdrifters.org/tracks/drift_X.html), the real drifters are distributed in different parts of the Gulf including one of the Southern Maine Community Colleage units that has made its way to the upper reaches of the Bay of Fundy.  As seen here at ![the animation here](doppio_235430701_8_14.mp4), it subjected to the enormous tides. The eastern portion of Digby Harbor is visible in the lower half of the frames.
