### Other News

The Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries recently released a report titled 
["Estimating the Costs of Using On-Demand Gear in Massachusetts Lobster 
Fisheries"](https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2023/07/31/Estimating%20the%20costs%20of%20using%20on-demand%20gear%20in%20Massachusetts%20lobster%20fisheries.pdf). The report indicates
that *"operational time costs and resulting decreases in catch
revenue associated with the decreased efficiency of the type of on-demand gear we used to
parameterize the model could be significant, reaching a similar level of cost to the acquisition of
the gear itself for some classes of lobster fishing vessel."*

### Announcements

- The [Woods Hole Science Stroll](https://woodsholesciencestroll.org/) is back on this year! Tomorrow (August 12), we welcome
anyone who's interested in meeting scientists and learning more about the work
we do to come down to Water Street in Woods Hole. In addition to the Cooperative
Research Branch staff many of you already know and other NOAA Fisheries scientists,
staff from other scientific organizations will be around giving demos of hardware 
and explaining their research. We'd be happy to have you stop in! Participating
organizations include:
    - Marine Biological Laboratory
    - US Coast Guard
    - US Geological Survey
    - Woodwell Climate Research Center
    - Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
  ...and more!

All the best,
George and JiM
